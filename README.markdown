Chinese Poker
=============

This is a Ruby on Rails app implementing a chinese poker game. User accounts
are authenticated with *OpenID*. It is also possible to embed the app as

You create a **match** inviting one to three other friends. Each player is notified
about the match, and allowed to set his hand. When all players have finished
setting their hands, the match is scored. Scores are accumulated across
matches between each pair of players.

The app is based on [Ruby on Rails][RoR], and uses the [YUI css/javascript library][YUI].
